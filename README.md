# real_time_fir_iir_filters

Ever needed a low pass filter for your VST? This crate has a wide selection of filters for real-time usage. It's designed to have as little runtime overhead as possible.

## How does it work?

Everything that can be computed at compile-time, will be, and the filter coefficients will be cached as well.

I then use the following algorithm to process the signal with as few steps as possible given the filter's coefficients:

(The figure is from: Alan V. Oppenheimer & Ronald W. Schafer - Discrete-Time Signal Processing)

## Example

```rust
use core::f64::consts::TAU;

use real_time_fir_iir_filters::{
    conf::LowPass,
    param::OmegaEpsilonXi,
    rtf::Rtf,
    filters::iir::second::SecondOrderEllipticFilter
};

// Initialize a 2. order elliptic low-pass filter at 440Hz
let mut filter = SecondOrderEllipticFilter::<LowPass>::new(
    OmegaEpsilonXi {
        omega: 440.0*TAU,
        epsilon: 0.5,
        xi: 1.5
    }
);

const N: usize = 10;
const RATE: f64 = 8000.0;

{
    // Unit impulse
    let mut imp_resp = [0.0; N];
    imp_resp[0] = 1.0;

    // Apply filter to imp_resp
    for x in &mut imp_resp
    {
        [*x] = filter.filter(RATE, *x);
    }

    // Prints the impulse response of the filter.
    println!("h[n] = {:?}", imp_resp);
}

// Resets internal state of filter to zero
filter.reset();

{
    // Generate frequency response for ω ∈ [0, 2π)
    let freq_resp = core::array::from_fn::<_, N, _>(|i| {
        let omega = i as f64/N as f64*TAU;

        filter.frequency_response(RATE, omega)
    });

    println!("H = {:?}", freq_resp);
}
```

## Adding your own filter

To make your own filter, you need to derive an expression for the Z-domain filter coefficients.

For analog circuits, you can use node or loop analysis to derive an expression for the filter's S-domain transfer function.

Once you have an S-plane representation, you can use the bilinear transform to find the Z-domain transfer function. The numerator and denominator of that expression
are your coefficients, and can be plugged directly into this library.

### Implementation

Once you have your coefficients, you can easily implement your own filter by using the macro [`def_rtf!`](crate::def_rtf).

Here's an example on how to implement your very own first-order low-pass filter:

```rust
#![feature(generic_const_exprs)]

use real_time_fir_iir_filters::param::{FirstOrderFilterParam, Omega, OmegaFirstOrder};

// This macro declares a struct for your filter, and implements all the necessary traits for it.
real_time_fir_iir_filters::def_rtf!(
    {
        /// My very own first-order low-pass filter.
        ///
        /// You can write your own doc-string here for your filter struct, just like you would document any other struct.
    }
    FirstOrderLowPassFilter
    {
        // Parameter type.
        // This type contains variables the user can set to modify the filter.
        type Param = OmegaFirstOrder;

        // Amount of outputs for the filter.
        // This is also how many numerators you need in the output-stage.
        // This is typically for when you want the filter to act as a low-pass and high-pass filter simultaneously.
        // This can be useful sometimes, since various configurations can often share filter coefficient denominators, so they can then re-use the same computation.
        const OUTPUTS: usize = 1;

        // The amount of separate buffers for the output stage.
        // This is also how many denominators you need in the output-stage.
        // `OUTPUTS` must be a multiple of `OUTPUT_BUFS`.
        // When you have less output buffers than outputs, denominators will be shared across outputs.
        const OUTPUT_BUFS: usize = 1;

        // The amount of separate buffers for the second-order section stages.
        // `OUTPUT_BUFS` must be a multiple of `SOS_BUFS`.
        // When you have less SOS-buffers than output buffers, the result of the final SOS-stage for each buffer will be shared across output-buffers.
        const SOS_BUFS: usize = 1;

        // The amount of additional second-order section stages.
        // Second-order sections allow computing filters with higher accuracy, by using a cascade of second order filters before the final stage (which can be any order).
        const SOS_STAGES: usize = 0;

        // The order of the output stage.
        // This means the output stage will have `ORDER + 1` coefficients.
        const ORDER: usize = 1;

        // Wether or not the filter has a denominator in its transfer function.
        const IS_IIR: bool = true;

        fn make_coeffs(param, rate) -> _
        {
            // This retrieves the parameter variable, and does the necessary calculations on fore-hand to then compute the filter-coefficients.
            // This code will only be ran after the filter parameter has changed, and the coefficients will be cached in the mean-time.
            let Omega {omega} = *param;
            let two_rate = rate + rate;

            // This contains the polynomial coefficients of the filter's transfer function in the Z-domain.
            // In this case, the transfer function (in the Z-domain) is on the form:
            // ```
            //        b0 + z⁻¹b1
            // H(z) = ----------
            //        a0 + z⁻¹a1
            // ```
            // For analog circuits, i typically use Kirchhoff's voltage or current law to find `H(s)`.
            // You can then find these Z-domain coefficients by applying the bilinear transform to `H(s)`.
            // Alternatively, there are some functions available in this library that does the bilinear transform for you for specific orders,
            // given the right S-domain coefficients. Those are only available for some specific filter orders.
            (
                // Numerator
